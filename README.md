## End-to-End Testing

We use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for E2E testing.

### Run tests locally

```bash
# Run with dev server automatically handled
npx playwright test
```

* Tests live in the `tests/` directory.
* Configuration: [`playwright.config.ts`](playwright.config.ts)

---

## CI/CD

We use **GitHub Actions** and **Vercel** for continuous integration and deployment:

### GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

* **Triggers:** Pull requests and pushes to `main`
* **Steps:**

  * `npm ci`
  * `npm run lint`
  * `npx playwright install --with-deps`
  * `npx playwright test`
  * `npm run build`
* Uses GitHub repo **secrets** for critical environment variables:

  * `MAILERLITE_API_KEY`
  * `MAILERLITE_LIST_ID`

### Vercel Deployment

* Auto-deploys every successful push to `main`
* Production: [https://www.brassroots.market](https://www.brassroots.market)
* **Environment Variables** managed via Vercel dashboard under
  `Settings â†’ Environment Variables`
